# DeepWalk

- Paper link: [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf)
- Other implementation: [gensim](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk), [deepwalk-c](https://github.com/xgfs/deepwalk-c)

The implementation includes multi-processing training with CPU and mixed training with CPU and multi-GPU.

## Dependencies
- PyTorch 1.0.1+

## Tested version
- PyTorch 1.5.0
- DGL 0.4.3


## Input data
Currently, we support two builtin dataset: youtube and blog. Use --data\_file youtube to select youtube dataset and --data\_file blog to select blog dataset.
The data is avaliable at  https://data.dgl.ai/dataset/DeepWalk/youtube.zip and https://data.dgl.ai/dataset/DeepWalk/blog.zip
The youtube.zip includes both youtube-net.txt, youtube-vocab.txt and youtube-label.txt; The blog.zip includes both blog-net.txt, blog-vocab.txt and blog-label.txt. 

For other datasets please pass the full path to the trainer through --data\_file and the format of a network file should follow:
```
1(node id) 2(node id)
1 3
1 4
2 4
...
```

## How to run the code
To run the code:
```
python3 deepwalk.py --data_file youtube --output_emb_file emb.txt --mix --lr 0.2 --gpus 0 1 2 3 --batch_size 100 --negative 5
```

## How to save the embedding
By default the trained embedding is saved under --output\_embe\_file FILE\_NAME as a numpy object.
To save the trained embedding in raw format(txt format), please use --save\_in\_txt argument.

## Evaluation
